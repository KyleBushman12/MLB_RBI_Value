# MLB_RBI_Value
Using play-by-play MLB data to evaluate a hitter's ability to record RBIs above expectation. When a batter is at the plate they always face a situation defined by a combination of runners on base and outs recorded. If we analyze play-by-play data, we can find an expected number of RBIs to be recorded by a hitter in each of these situations. After obtaining an estimated for expected number of RBIs (xRBI) in each situation, we can look at all situations faced by all hitters in a season to determine how many RBIs were expected for that player in that season. Finally, we can compare their actual RBI totals to their expected total to find out who overperformed and by how much. Knowing this could be vital for identifying clutch hitters who perform best when RBIs are within reach. Use the .Rmd file and provided MLB data to explore RBI value (vRBI) for yourself.
